    "Cloud Computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware/systems software in the datacenters that provide those services. The datacenter hardware and software is what we will call a _Cloud_. When a Cloud is made available to the public (through pay-as-you-go services), it is called a Public Cloud; the service being sold from the datacenter to the provider such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon or IBM (which might or not might be the same) called computing utility [[1](#Footnotes)] and the one sold from provider to user that we will refer as a web application or more in general a service. Current examples of public computing services include AmazonWeb Services, Google AppEngine, and Microsoft Azure. A differenet deployment system from the public is the private. The private Cloud refers to internal datacenters of a business or other organization that are not made available to the public. The figure below shows the roles of the people as users or providers of different layers of the Cloud.\n",

    " - The Infrastructure as a Service (**IaaS**) is a cloud of resources provided to users. IaaS provides the basic functionality of storage and computing as service consisting in network servers, storage systems, network instrumentality, and information headquarters.\n",
    " - The Platform as a Service (**PaaS**) is a development environment provided as a service. These advanced levels of alternative service can be designed by end-users. PaaS offers virtualized servers that multiple users work on applications or grow innovative applications, with no having to concern about keeping operating systems, server hardware, equalization or weight power calculation.\n",
    " - The Software as a Service (**SaaS**) is an application that is offered to consumers using the Internetwork. A single case of service works in the cloud and multiple end users services. An example of Cloud Computing is Software as a Service (SaaS), where you input data on software and the data is transformed remotely through a software interface without your computer being involved. Thus SaaS eliminates client fears on storage, server applications, application development, and related common concerns of IT. \n",
