**Exercise/Homework**

There are 9 homework to complete. They will be released at the end of each regular week Lecture and due the next one. The homework are graded on a scale 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest grade.

**Quizzes** 

There will be a quiz at the beginning of each Seminar/Reading Club class based on what was discussed in lecture and contained in the assigned readings. Students will have a limited amount of time to complete the quiz. 40% of the quizzes will be dropped before calculating your final grade.

**Presentation**

Every Seminar two groups will be presenting the reading material assingned at the beginning of the week.

**Practicum**

There will be a final group project due during Exams period encompassing all the material learned in class.

**Submitting an Assignment**

Instructions for turning in assignments will be posted when the semester starts.

**Presentation Guidelines**

Prsentation will be graded based on:

1. Summary, main topics of the readings.
2. Motivations, relevant reasons for the application.
3. How the authors approached and solved the problem. 
4. Key assumptions underping the technology.
5. Key ideas. 
6. Methodology, schematic steps to solve the problem. 
7. Applications, description of real world application. 
8. Future readings and why. Students seek for supporting literature for improving technology (min 1, max 3).

## Course Policies  

**Collaboration Policy**
 
We encourage you to talk and discuss the assignments with your fellow students.  Discussion is encouraged, **copying is not allowed**.

**Late Day Policy**

Homework is due on Tuesdays before class. No late day per homework.

**Re-Grading Policy**

We take great care in making sure all homework are graded properly. Contact instructors for any issue.

**Communication from Staff to Students**

Class announcements will be through **Canvas**. All homework and quizzes will be posted and submitted in Canvas (TBD_QUIZZES). Also all feedback forms.

**Academic Honesty**

Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in AC295 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together.

**Accommodations for students with disabilities**
 
Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the [Accessible Education Office](http://www.aeo.fas.harvard.edu/)(AEO) and speak with Kevin by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, September 15.  Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential.

# Topics in Applied Computation: <br> Advanced Practical Data Science
### AC295


## Syllabus - Spring 2020

Welcome to AC295 Advanced Practical Data Science. This course is the third of a series of data science after AC209A and AC209B. The course focuses on applied and practical topics in data science. 

The material of the course is divided into 3 modules. The main goal is to prepare students for topics in deploying data science applications. 

**1.** How to scale a model from a prototype to the cloud.

**2.**  How to use existing models using transfer learning or techniques to speed up existing models such as distilliation and compression. 

**3.** How to use visualization tools for investigating properties and diagnosing issues of models.

#### **Lectures**

The class consists of two weekly lectures. Lectures are held Tues 4:30 pm ‐ 6:30 pm (to be discussed).  At the beginning of each class we will review the one from previous week, followed by the one from the current and in-class exercise to assess your understanding of the material and to help us identify gaps. Attendance to lectures is mandatory. 

**Labs**

Labs are designed as hands-on in-class activities (both groups and individuals). The instructor will go over practice problems and review difficult material. Attendance at labs is mandatory. Lab sessions are held on Thursday from 4:30 pm ‐ 6:30 pm.

#### **Accommodations for Students with Disabilities**

Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the [Accessible Education Office](http://www.aeo.fas.harvard.edu/) (AEO) and speak with Kevin by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, September 15. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential.


#### **Diversity and Inclusion Statement**

Data Science, like many fields of science, has historically only been represented by a small sliver of the population. This is despite some of the early computer scientist pioneers being women (see [Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) and [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) for two examples). Recent initiatives have attempted to overcome some barriers to entry: [Made /w Code](https://www.madewithcode.com/).

We would like to attempt to discuss diversity in data science from time to time where appropriate and possible. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the diversity of the course materials. Furthermore, we would like to create a learning environment for our students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Harvard records, please let us know!

If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion.

We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.)

As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.


#### **Academic Honesty**

Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in AC209 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty.

As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets and allow submission in pairs for most problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together.
