Software We will be using a variety of software primarily Python 3, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Docker, etc. More details in class. Course Structure and Activities The course is organized in three modules each one 4 weeks long. Each module is structured in three types of activities and they are: Lectures , Reading Discussion , and Practicum . Each activity requires the students to complete different assignments in the form of exercise/homework, quizzes, reading assignment and presentation (see Assignments below). During the first 3 weeks of each modules students will attend Lecture on Tuesday and Reading Discussion on Thursday. The fourth week of each module will be Practicum on Tuesday and Thursday. Attendance is mandatory . Reading List consists in papers, blogs and other reading material that will be realesed at the beginning of each week. This will be the base for all the activities during the week. Lectures are held on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:45 pm in Cruft 309. During this activity we will discuss and summarize the basic concepts of the material covered during the week. Reading Discussion are held on Thursdays from 4:30-5:45 pm in in Cruft 309. During this activity two groups will present to the rest of the class one/two papers from the Reading List and lead the discussion. See Presentation Guildelines below. Practicum are activities in the form of a project based on the material covered in the module. The students will work in group and expect to deliver a complete assignment in 10 days. There will be three practicum. Resources A brief list of the resources can be found below: Resource_Name Assignments The final grade will be calculated using the following weights for each assignment: Exercises There are 9 homework to complete. They will be released at the end of each regular week Lecture and due the next one. The homework are graded on a scale 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest grade. Quizzes There will be a quiz at the beginning of each Reading Discussion based on what was discussed during lecture. The question will cover some of the material from Reading List and students will access them using Ed Platform . Students will have a limited amount of time to complete the quiz. 40% of the quizzes will be dropped before calculating your final grade. Presentations Every Reading Discussion two groups will be presenting the reading material assingned at the beginning of the week. Practicums There will be a final group project due during Exams period encompassing all the material learned in class. Projects There will be a final group project due during Exams period encompassing all the material learned in class. Assignment Final Grade Weight Quizzes 9% Exercises 9% Presentations 15% Practicums 45% Projects 20% Participation 2% Total 100% Getting Help For questions about exercise, course content, package installation, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is: Go to Office Hours , this is the best way to get help. Post the question in Ed Forum and hopefully your peers will answer. Course Policies Collaboration Policy We encourage you to talk and discuss the assignments with your fellow students. Discussion is encouraged. Presentation during Reading Discussion, Practicum and Projects are group activities. Communication from Staff to Students Class announcements will be through Ed Forum . Academic Honesty Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in AC295 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. Accommodations for students with disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with Kevin by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, September 15. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"Resource 1","text":"Resource NAME","tags":"resources","url":"resources/resource1/"},{"title":"Lecture 1","text":"Slides Lecture 1: Introduction Forms Form: Make Group Form: Sign Up Presentation","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture1/"},{"title":"Lecture 10","text":"Slides Lecture 10: Title Jupyter Notebooks Lecture 10: Title","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture10/"},{"title":"Lecture 2","text":"Slides Lecture 2: Title Jupyter Notebooks Lecture 2: Title","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture2/"},{"title":"Lecture 3","text":"Slides Lecture 3: Title Jupyter Notebooks Lecture 3: Title","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture3/"},{"title":"Lecture 4","text":"Slides Lecture 4: Dask Jupyter Notebooks Lecture 4: Data Science with Python and Dask","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture4/"},{"title":"Lecture 5","text":"Slides Lecture 5: Title Jupyter Notebooks Lecture 5: Title","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture5/"},{"title":"Lecture 6","text":"Slides Lecture 6: Title Jupyter Notebooks Lecture 6: Title","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture6/"},{"title":"Lecture 7","text":"Slides Lecture 7: Title Jupyter Notebooks Lecture 7: Title","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture7/"},{"title":"Lecture 8","text":"Slides Lecture 8: Title Jupyter Notebooks Lecture 8: Title","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture8/"},{"title":"Lecture 9","text":"Slides Lecture 9: Title Jupyter Notebooks Lecture 9: Title","tags":"lectures","url":"lectures/lecture9/"},{"title":"Practicum 1","text":"Problem Set 1 Data 1 Resources","tags":"practicum","url":"practicum/practicum1/"},{"title":"Practicum 2","text":"Problem Set 2 Data 2 Resources","tags":"practicum","url":"practicum/practicum2/"},{"title":"Practicum 3","text":"Problem Set 3 Data 3 Resources","tags":"practicum","url":"practicum/practicum3/"},{"title":"Projects","text":"Project 1 Data 1 Resources","tags":"projects","url":"projects/project1/"},{"title":"Reading Discussion 1: Environments, Virtual Machines and Containers","text":"Selected Readings Getting started with Python environments (using Conda) Creating Python Virtual Environments with Conda: Why and How Virtual Machine Wikipedia How to Install a Totally Free Windows 10 OS on Your Mac for Fun and Profit Data Science for Startups: Containers Docker for Data Scientists Docker: Lightweight Linux Containers for Consistent Development and Deployment Comparison of different Linux containers Singularity: Scientific containers for mobility of compute Performance Evaluation of Container-based Virtualization for High Performance Computing Environments Selected readings for presentation","tags":"readings","url":"readings/reading1/"},{"title":"Reading Discussion 2: Kubernetes","text":"Selected Readings Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture Why Kubernetes is a Considerable Step Forward in Software Products Development?

In this course we explore advanced practical data science practices. The course will be divided into three major topics: 1. How to scale a model from a prototype (often in jupyter notebooks) to the cloud. In this module, we cover virtual environments, containers, and virtual machines before learning about microservices and Kubernetes. Along the way, students will be exposed to Dask. 2. How to use existing models for transfer learning. Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. This can be very important, given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and given the huge jumps in skill that these models can provide to related problems. In this part of the course we will examine various pre-existing models and techniques in transfer learning. 3. In the third part we will be introducing a number of intuitive visualization tools for investigating properties and diagnosing issues of models. We will be demonstrating a number of visualization tools ranging from the well established (like saliency maps) to recent ones that have appeared in https://distill.pub.

Here are some highlights: You can use them \"anytime, anywhere\": public cloud users can access, barely always, cloud services and keep their data stored safely in the infrastructure. You won't need to plan far ahead for provisioning: public cloud users can use infinite computing and storaging resources available on demand. In this way, the user can offload some problems to the service provider such as mantaining both hardware and software. You can buy what you need, when you need it: public cloud allows you to use services eliminating any sort of up-front commitment by Cloud user. Public cloud allows teams to collaborate: Public cloud allows you to share data and collaborate more easily. Public cloud basics Cloud Computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware/systems software in the datacenters that provide those services. The datacenter hardware and software is what we will call a Cloud . When a Cloud is made available to the public (through pay-as-you-go services), it is called a Public Cloud; the service being sold from the datacenter to the provider such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon or IBM (which might or not might be the same) called computing utility [ 1 ] and the one sold from provider to user that we will refer as a web application or more in general a service. Current examples of public computing services include AmazonWeb Services, Google AppEngine, and Microsoft Azure. A differenet deployment system from the public is the private. The private Cloud refers to internal datacenters of a business or other organization that are not made available to the public. The figure below shows the roles of the people as users or providers of different layers of the Cloud. Image adapted from Armbust et al., 2009 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud as [ 2 ]: \"a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.\" Cloud computing has 5 essential characteristics: Measured Service Rapid Elasticity Broad Network Access Resource Pooling On Demand Self Service You can think about cloud computing as composition of three different areas/models: The Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) is a cloud of resources provided to users. IaaS provides the basic functionality of storage and computing as service consisting in network servers, storage systems, network instrumentality, and information headquarters. The Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) is a development environment provided as a service. These advanced levels of alternative service can be designed by end-users. PaaS offers virtualized servers that multiple users work on applications or grow innovative applications, with no having to concern about keeping operating systems, server hardware, equalization or weight power calculation. The Software as a Service ( SaaS ) is an application that is offered to consumers using the Internetwork. A single case of service works in the cloud and multiple end users services. An example of Cloud Computing is Software as a Service (SaaS), where you input data on software and the data is transformed remotely through a software interface without your computer being involved. Thus SaaS eliminates client fears on storage, server applications, application development, and related common concerns of IT. In this to tutorial we are going to show you examples encompasses PaaS, when you will build the experiment using the two tutorials, and SaaS, when you will learn how to use the cloud services in the three guides. Cloud pros and cons Overall, the advantages of using a cloud outperforms the disadvantage. When deciding to build your own application, which an example in this series of guides is the experiment, it is important to consider a couple of aspects: cloud security, and cloud service accuracy. In respect to the first, we reccomend making sure that data being stored in the cloud meet the requirements of your institution/research as well as checking the warranty of the chosen provider. In respect to the second, we suggest to consider the accuracy of the algorithm provided by the service for the purpose of the research but this fall outside the purpose of this workshop. Naeem et al.[ 3 ] discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages when using cloud computing. We report them from their study in the chart below: Disadvantages Advantages Security in the Cloud Almost Unlimited Storage Technical Issues Quick Development Non-Interoperability Cost Efficient Dependency and vendor lock-in Automatic Software Integration Internet Required Shared Resources Less Reliability Easy Access to Information Less management Mobility Raised Vulnerability Better Hardware Management Prone to Attack Backup and Recovery Getting started: first access to Azure Create your Azure free account To access Azure cloud computing services, you will have to sign up for an Azure free account, if you don't already have one. If you do not have a Microsoft account either you will be asked to create one, otherwise insert your outlook account (e.g. your_email_address@outlook.com). To create your Azure account you will be asked to add your credentials as well as a credit card account. This will not be charged unless you exceed the credit provided with the one month trial version [ 4 ]. We reccomend to cancel the account after the first month in case you are not interested in the service. Follow the next steps to set up a free account: Go to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/ and click on free account Click on start free Create an Azure account: choose name, set password, add security info, add credit/debit card information Login to Azure Dashboard and create your first service Once you have created your Azure free account, you just need to go to the Azure portal and login using the credentials. Go to https://portal.azure.com/ and sign-in to your account to access Azure Dashboard (note: familiarize with the relevant services?) You are now ready to deploy your first public cloud service! Follow the next steps: Click on create a resource Write on the bar the name of the service you want to subscribe to. For convinience we show the Storage Account that will we use in the next guide. Type storage account in the bar and then press enter You will be directed to the a view containing a short description of the service, as well as links to the documentation and pricing information. Click on create to start deploying the services. Next, complete entering the following intormation and click on create once finished: Account name: enter lowercase and globally unique name (e.g. \"mycloudstorageplayground\") Deployment model: click on Resource manager Account kind: Storage v1 Location: East US Replication: Locally-reduntant storage (LRS) Performance: click on Standard Secure transfer required: Enabled Subscription: Free Trial Select server region: Eastus Resource Group: create a new entering name (e.g. myresourcegroup) Virtual networks: click on Enabled Pin to dashboard (optional): [x] Once the service is deployed, you will see on your Dashbord a white box with your storage account's name. Click on the box with your storage_account_name to access the storage account interface. The storage account interface shows a summary of the settings defined in the previous steps and other utilities. On the top right box you can see the region from which your service is deployied, the type of storage you have choosen as well as the type of contents you decided to store (i.e. Locally Reduntant Storage which stands for data you might use a lot and the server will know). You can also find the id of your subrscition below erased for privacy purposes. Create API key to use Microsoft Azure service We have shown you how to login to the Azure portal and how to create a Storage Account, now it is time to retrieve the key necessary to use it. We will use the key in the next guide to make requests to Microsoft Azure using Application Programming Interface (API). The API functions as an intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other, in our case our software and Azure SaaS. The API key allows Azure to identifies your subscription account and to bill it (unless you switch your free account to a pay as you go account your account will not be billed). To retrieve your Storage Account key, start from going to the dashboard and clicking on the box with your storage_account_name . Then, click on on Access keys on the side bar. Copy storage account name and key1, clicking on the icon in the left, and paste them in the script below. Script: create a set of keys for using Azure services In the next guides, we are going to poke around with several Azure services. We reccomend you to create all the services on the list below and to save the name you will give to each service and primary key in the cell below. Here is a complete list of the services that you should create: Storage Account Face Computer Vision Bing Speech Recognition Text Analytics When looking for a service, we recommend to click on the Create a Resource button and to copy each service name on the finder bar as shown before.

Add general description. Dask is a useful tools 2. Add infrastructure/platform description. Link to documentation Dask and why it is cool Dask developer community on twitter . Dask is a useful tools 3. a) What you can do you, b) what other advanced things people do. We'll go over the basics of some Dask services, but we should point out that a lot of talented people have given tutorials, check'em out.

The datacenter hardware and software is what we will call a Cloud . When a Cloud is made available to the public (through pay-as-you-go services), it is called a Public Cloud; the service being sold from the datacenter to the provider such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon or IBM (which might or not might be the same) called computing utility [ 1 ] and the one sold from provider to user that we will refer as a web application or more in general a service. Current examples of public computing services include AmazonWeb Services, Google AppEngine, and Microsoft Azure. A differenet deployment system from the public is the private. The private Cloud refers to internal datacenters of a business or other organization that are not made available to the public. The figure below shows the roles of the people as users or providers of different layers of the Cloud. Image adapted from Armbust et al., 2009 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud as [ 2 ]: \"a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.\" Cloud computing has 5 essential characteristics: Measured Service Rapid Elasticity Broad Network Access Resource Pooling On Demand Self Service You can think about cloud computing as composition of three different areas/models: The Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) is a cloud of resources provided to users. IaaS provides the basic functionality of storage and computing as service consisting in network servers, storage systems, network instrumentality, and information headquarters. The Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) is a development environment provided as a service. These advanced levels of alternative service can be designed by end-users. PaaS offers virtualized servers that multiple users work on applications or grow innovative applications, with no having to concern about keeping operating systems, server hardware, equalization or weight power calculation. The Software as a Service ( SaaS ) is an application that is offered to consumers using the Internetwork. A single case of service works in the cloud and multiple end users services. An example of Cloud Computing is Software as a Service (SaaS), where you input data on software and the data is transformed remotely through a software interface without your computer being involved. Thus SaaS eliminates client fears on storage, server applications, application development, and related common concerns of IT. In this to tutorial we are going to show you examples encompasses PaaS, when you will build the experiment using the two tutorials, and SaaS, when you will learn how to use the cloud services in the three guides.
