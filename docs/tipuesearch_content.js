This course is the third of a series of data science after AC209A and AC209B. The course focuses on applied and practical topics in data science. The material of the course is divided into 3 modules. The main goal is to prepare students for topics in deploying data science applications. 1. How to scale a model from a prototype to the cloud. 2. How to use existing models using transfer learning or techniques to speed up existing models such as distilliation and compression. 3. How to use visualization tools for investigating properties and diagnosing issues of models. List of Contents Prerequisites Software Course Activities Instructor Office Hours Recommended Textbook Assignments Course Policies Prerequisites You are expected to have programming experience at the level of CS 50 or above, statistics knowledge at the level of Stat 110 or above, basic data science (or machine learning) at the level of AC209A and AC209B. Software We will be using a variety of software primarily Python 3. More details in class. Course Activities The course is structured in two different types of activities that repeat themselves each week and they are: Lectures, Labs. >>>>> gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Syllabus0.jpg). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. ( Back to top )( Next alert ) >>>>> Lectures The class consists of two weekly lectures. Lectures are held Tues 4:30 pm ‐ 6:30 pm (to be discussed). At the beginning of each class we will review the one from previous week, followed by the one from the current and in-class exercise to assess your understanding of the material and to help us identify gaps. Attendance to lectures is mandatory. Labs Labs are designed as hands-on in-class activities (both groups and individuals). The instructor will go over practice problems and review difficult material. Attendance at labs is mandatory. Lab sessions are held on Thursday from 4:30 pm ‐ 6:30 pm.

Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential. Diversity and Inclusion Statement Data Science, like many fields of science, has historically only been represented by a small sliver of the population. This is despite some of the early computer scientist pioneers being women (see Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper for two examples). Recent initiatives have attempted to overcome some barriers to entry: Made /w Code . We would like to attempt to discuss diversity in data science from time to time where appropriate and possible. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the diversity of the course materials. Furthermore, we would like to create a learning environment for our students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Harvard records, please let us know! If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion. We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.) As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates. Academic Honesty Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in AC209 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets and allow submission in pairs for most problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"Reading 6:","text":"Reading How transferable are features in deep neural networks? https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792 Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531 An embarrassingly simple approach to zero-shot learning http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/romera-paredes15.pdf A survey on Transfer Learning https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qyang/Docs/2009/tkde_transfer_learning.pdf Tools: Nvidia toolkit: https://developer.nvidia.com/transfer-learning-toolkit","tags":"readings","url":"readings/reading6/"},{"title":"Topics in Applied Computation: Advanced Practical Data Science","text":"Spring 2020 Pavlos Protopapas pre { background-color: #F5F5F5; display: block; font-family: monospace; font-size: 14px; white-space: pre; border-color: #999999; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; border-radius: 6px; margin: 1em 0; padding: 5px; white-space: pre-wrap; } .containerMain { display: flex; width: 100%; height: 300px; } .contentA { flex: 1; flex-direction:column; } .contentB { flex: 3; } Lab Leader: Andrea Porelli Welcome to AC295. In this course we explore advanced practical data science practices. The course will be divided into three major topics: 1. How to scale a model from a prototype (often in jupyter notebooks) to the cloud. In this module, we cover virtual environments, containers, and virtual machines before learning about microservices and Kupernetes. Along the way, students will be exposed to Dask. 2. How to use existing models for transfer learning. Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. This can be very important, given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and given the huge jumps in skill that these models can provide to related problems. In this part of the course we will examine various pre-existing models and techniques in transfer learning. 3. In the third part we will be introducing a number of intuitive visualization tools for investigating properties and diagnosing issues of models. We will be demonstrating a number of visualization tools ranging from the well established (like saliency maps) to recent ones that have appeared in https://distill.pub. 4.
