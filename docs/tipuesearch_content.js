Recurrent Neural Networks for Text Data Course Activities Each module is structured in three types of activities and they are: Lectures , Reading Discussion , and Practicum . Each activity requires the students to complete different assignments in the form of exercise/homework, quizzes, reading assignment, and presentation (see Assignments below). During the first 3 weeks of each module, students will attend Lecture on Tuesday and Reading Discussion on Thursday. The fourth week of each module will be Practicum on Tuesday and Thursday. Attendance is mandatory . Reading List consists in papers, blogs and other reading material that will be released no later than the beginning of each week. This will be the base for all the activities during the week See Readings Guidelines here link to guidelines . Lectures are held on Tuesdays from 4:30-5:45 pm in Cruft 309. During this activity we will discuss and summarize the basic concepts of the material covered during the week. Reading Discussions are held on Thursdays from 4:30-5:45 pm in in Cruft 309. During this activity, two groups will present to the rest of the class one or two papers from the Reading List and lead the discussion. See Paper Presentation Guidelines here link to guidelines . Practicum are activities in the form of a project based on the material covered in the module. The students will work in groups and be expected to deliver a complete assignment in 10 days. There will be three practicum. Resources A brief list of the resources can be found below: Resource_Name Assignments The final grade will be calculated using the following weights for each assignment: Exercises There are 9 homework to complete. They will be released at the end of each regular week Lecture and due the next one. The homework are graded on a scale 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest grade. Quizzes There will be a quiz at the beginning of each Reading Discussion based on what was discussed during lecture. The question will cover some of the material from Reading List and students will access them using Ed Platform on Canvas (select Ed from tab on course main page). Students will have a limited amount of time to complete the quiz. 40% of the quizzes will be dropped before calculating your final grade. Presentations At every Reading Discussion, two groups will present the reading material assigned at the beginning of the week. Please see these on the presentations. Practicums There will be a final group project due during Exams period encompassing all the material learned in class. Projects There will be a final group project due during Exams period encompassing all the material learned in class. Assignment Final Grade Weight Quizzes 9% Exercises 9% Presentations 15% Practicums 45% Projects 20% Participation 2% Total 100% Getting Help For questions about exercise, course content, package installation, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is: Go to Office Hours , this is the best way to get help. Post the question in Ed Forum and hopefully your peers will answer. Course Policies Collaboration Policy We encourage you to talk and discuss the assignments with your fellow students. Discussion is encouraged. Presentation during Reading Discussion, Practicum and Projects are group activities. Communication from Staff to Students Class announcements will be through Ed Forum . Academic Honesty Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in AC295 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. Accommodations for students with disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with Pavlos by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, February 14. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"Reading Discussion 9: Recurrent Neural Networks for Text Data","text":"Selected Readings Expository Visualizations of Recurrent Neural Networks Attention and Augmented Recurrent Neural Networks Man is to Doctor as Woman is to Nurse: the Gender Bias of Word Embeddings Research Visualizing memorization in RNNs Understanding the Origins of Bias in Word Embeddings ConceptVector: Text Visual Analytics via Interactive Lexicon Building using Word Embedding","tags":"readings","url":"readings/reading9/"},{"title":"Reading Discussion 8: Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Data","text":"Selected Readings Expository How to visualize convolutional features in 40 lines of code Visualizing what ConvNets learn Research Feature Visualization The Building Blocks of Interpretability Visualizing Deep Neural Network Decisions: Prediction Difference Analysis","tags":"readings","url":"readings/reading8/"},{"title":"Reading Discussion 6: Distillation and Compression","text":"Selected Readings Expository Research An embarrassingly simple approach to zero-shot learning Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network Distilling a neural network into a soft decision tree Model compression Resources NVIDIA Transfer Learning Toolkit","tags":"readings","url":"readings/reading6/"},{"title":"Reading Discussion 7: Introduction and Overview of Viz for Deep Models","text":"Selected Readings Expository Google \"What If...\" , The What-If Tool: Interactive Probing of Machine Learning Models TensorBoard , Using Tensorboard Visualizing MNIST: An Exploration of Dimensionality Reduction Research Visual Analytics in Deep Learning Why Should I Trust You?\" Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier Interpretability Beyond Feature Attribution","tags":"readings","url":"readings/reading7/"},{"title":"Reading Discussion 5: Transfer Learning across Tasks","text":"Selected Readings Expository Research Matching embeddings for Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation One-shot learning of object categories An embarrassingly simple approach to zero-shot learning Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks Few-Shot Adversarial Domain Adaptation","tags":"readings","url":"readings/reading5/"},{"title":"Reading Discussion 4: Intro to Transfer Learning: Basic Transfer Learning and SOTA Models","text":"Selected Readings Expository Transfer Learning using Mobilenet and Keras Image Classification using Features Extracted by Transfer Learning in Keras, Part 1 - Image Classification using Features Extracted by Transfer Learning in Keras, Part 2 Image Classification using Features Extracted by Transfer Learning in Keras, Part 3 Image Classification using Features Extracted by Transfer Learning in Keras, Part 4 Transfer learning with a pretrained ConvNet Research A survey on Transfer Learning How transferable are features in deep neural networks?

In this course we explore advanced practical data science practices. The course will be divided into three major topics: 1. How to scale a model from a prototype (often in jupyter notebooks) to the cloud. In this module, we cover virtual environments, containers, and virtual machines before learning about microservices and Kubernetes. Along the way, students will be exposed to Dask. 2. How to use existing models for transfer learning. Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. This can be very important, given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and given the huge jumps in skill that these models can provide to related problems. In this part of the course we will examine various pre-existing models and techniques in transfer learning. 3. In the third part we will be introducing a number of intuitive visualization tools for investigating properties and diagnosing issues of models. We will be demonstrating a number of visualization tools ranging from the well established (like saliency maps) to recent ones that have appeared in https://distill.pub.

Here are some highlights: You can use them \"anytime, anywhere\": public cloud users can access, barely always, cloud services and keep their data stored safely in the infrastructure. You won't need to plan far ahead for provisioning: public cloud users can use infinite computing and storaging resources available on demand. In this way, the user can offload some problems to the service provider such as mantaining both hardware and software. You can buy what you need, when you need it: public cloud allows you to use services eliminating any sort of up-front commitment by Cloud user. Public cloud allows teams to collaborate: Public cloud allows you to share data and collaborate more easily. Public cloud basics Cloud Computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware/systems software in the datacenters that provide those services. The datacenter hardware and software is what we will call a Cloud . When a Cloud is made available to the public (through pay-as-you-go services), it is called a Public Cloud; the service being sold from the datacenter to the provider such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon or IBM (which might or not might be the same) called computing utility [ 1 ] and the one sold from provider to user that we will refer as a web application or more in general a service. Current examples of public computing services include AmazonWeb Services, Google AppEngine, and Microsoft Azure. A differenet deployment system from the public is the private. The private Cloud refers to internal datacenters of a business or other organization that are not made available to the public. The figure below shows the roles of the people as users or providers of different layers of the Cloud. Image adapted from Armbust et al., 2009 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud as [ 2 ]: \"a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.\" Cloud computing has 5 essential characteristics: Measured Service Rapid Elasticity Broad Network Access Resource Pooling On Demand Self Service You can think about cloud computing as composition of three different areas/models: The Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) is a cloud of resources provided to users. IaaS provides the basic functionality of storage and computing as service consisting in network servers, storage systems, network instrumentality, and information headquarters. The Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) is a development environment provided as a service. These advanced levels of alternative service can be designed by end-users. PaaS offers virtualized servers that multiple users work on applications or grow innovative applications, with no having to concern about keeping operating systems, server hardware, equalization or weight power calculation. The Software as a Service ( SaaS ) is an application that is offered to consumers using the Internetwork. A single case of service works in the cloud and multiple end users services. An example of Cloud Computing is Software as a Service (SaaS), where you input data on software and the data is transformed remotely through a software interface without your computer being involved. Thus SaaS eliminates client fears on storage, server applications, application development, and related common concerns of IT. In this to tutorial we are going to show you examples encompasses PaaS, when you will build the experiment using the two tutorials, and SaaS, when you will learn how to use the cloud services in the three guides. Cloud pros and cons Overall, the advantages of using a cloud outperforms the disadvantage. When deciding to build your own application, which an example in this series of guides is the experiment, it is important to consider a couple of aspects: cloud security, and cloud service accuracy. In respect to the first, we reccomend making sure that data being stored in the cloud meet the requirements of your institution/research as well as checking the warranty of the chosen provider. In respect to the second, we suggest to consider the accuracy of the algorithm provided by the service for the purpose of the research but this fall outside the purpose of this workshop. Naeem et al.[ 3 ] discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages when using cloud computing. We report them from their study in the chart below: Disadvantages Advantages Security in the Cloud Almost Unlimited Storage Technical Issues Quick Development Non-Interoperability Cost Efficient Dependency and vendor lock-in Automatic Software Integration Internet Required Shared Resources Less Reliability Easy Access to Information Less management Mobility Raised Vulnerability Better Hardware Management Prone to Attack Backup and Recovery Getting started: first access to Azure Create your Azure free account To access Azure cloud computing services, you will have to sign up for an Azure free account, if you don't already have one. If you do not have a Microsoft account either you will be asked to create one, otherwise insert your outlook account (e.g. your_email_address@outlook.com). To create your Azure account you will be asked to add your credentials as well as a credit card account. This will not be charged unless you exceed the credit provided with the one month trial version [ 4 ]. We reccomend to cancel the account after the first month in case you are not interested in the service. Follow the next steps to set up a free account: Go to https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/ and click on free account Click on start free Create an Azure account: choose name, set password, add security info, add credit/debit card information Login to Azure Dashboard and create your first service Once you have created your Azure free account, you just need to go to the Azure portal and login using the credentials. Go to https://portal.azure.com/ and sign-in to your account to access Azure Dashboard (note: familiarize with the relevant services?) You are now ready to deploy your first public cloud service! Follow the next steps: Click on create a resource Write on the bar the name of the service you want to subscribe to. For convinience we show the Storage Account that will we use in the next guide. Type storage account in the bar and then press enter You will be directed to the a view containing a short description of the service, as well as links to the documentation and pricing information. Click on create to start deploying the services. Next, complete entering the following intormation and click on create once finished: Account name: enter lowercase and globally unique name (e.g. \"mycloudstorageplayground\") Deployment model: click on Resource manager Account kind: Storage v1 Location: East US Replication: Locally-reduntant storage (LRS) Performance: click on Standard Secure transfer required: Enabled Subscription: Free Trial Select server region: Eastus Resource Group: create a new entering name (e.g. myresourcegroup) Virtual networks: click on Enabled Pin to dashboard (optional): [x] Once the service is deployed, you will see on your Dashbord a white box with your storage account's name. Click on the box with your storage_account_name to access the storage account interface. The storage account interface shows a summary of the settings defined in the previous steps and other utilities. On the top right box you can see the region from which your service is deployied, the type of storage you have choosen as well as the type of contents you decided to store (i.e. Locally Reduntant Storage which stands for data you might use a lot and the server will know). You can also find the id of your subrscition below erased for privacy purposes. Create API key to use Microsoft Azure service We have shown you how to login to the Azure portal and how to create a Storage Account, now it is time to retrieve the key necessary to use it. We will use the key in the next guide to make requests to Microsoft Azure using Application Programming Interface (API). The API functions as an intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other, in our case our software and Azure SaaS. The API key allows Azure to identifies your subscription account and to bill it (unless you switch your free account to a pay as you go account your account will not be billed). To retrieve your Storage Account key, start from going to the dashboard and clicking on the box with your storage_account_name . Then, click on on Access keys on the side bar. Copy storage account name and key1, clicking on the icon in the left, and paste them in the script below. Script: create a set of keys for using Azure services In the next guides, we are going to poke around with several Azure services. We reccomend you to create all the services on the list below and to save the name you will give to each service and primary key in the cell below. Here is a complete list of the services that you should create: Storage Account Face Computer Vision Bing Speech Recognition Text Analytics When looking for a service, we recommend to click on the Create a Resource button and to copy each service name on the finder bar as shown before. This will avoid you to look for service at the time, and some headache from navigating yourself through the myriad of services available. Run the cell when you are done, and a file with your key will be automatically generated and stored into the folder public_cloud_computing/guides/keys.

Actually it would generate greater overheads. very useful for medium size dataset; it allows to work with medium size in local machine. Python was not designed to make sharing work between processes on multicore systems particularly easy. As a result, it can be difficult to take advantage of parallelism within Pandas. essential for large datasets: Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn are not suitable at all for datasets of this size, because they were not inherently built to operate on distributed datasets. This provide help for using libraries Dataset type Size range Fits in RAM? Fits on local disk? Small dataset Less than 2–4 GB Yes Yes Medium dataset Less than 2 TB No Yes Large dataset Greater than 2 TB No No Adapted from Data Science with Python and Dask Dask consists of several different components and APIs, which can be categorized into three layers: the scheduler: add_definition/explanation; low-level APIs: add_definition/explanation; and high-level APIs: add_definition/explanation . Adapted from Data Science with Python and Dask 1.2 Directed acyclical graph (DAGs) graph : is a representation of a set of objects that have a relationship with one another >>> good to represent a wide variety of information. A graph is compounded by: - *node*: a function, an object or an action - *line*: symbolizes the relationship among nodes directed acyclical graph : there is one logical way to traverse the graph. No node is visited twice. cyclical graph : exists a feedback loop that allow to revisit and repeat the actions within the same node. handle computational resources : as the problem we solve requires more resources we have two options: -*scale up*: increase size of the available resource. invest in more efficient technology, cons diminishing returns -*scale out*: add other resources (dask main idea). invest in more cheap resources, cons distribute workload concurrency : as we approach greater number of \"work to be completed\", some resources might be not fully exploited. For instance some might be idling because of insufficient shared resources (i.e. resource starvation) . Schedulers handle this issue making sure to provide sufficient resources to each worker. failures : - work failures: a worker leave, and you know have to assign another one to his task. This might potentially slowing down the execution, however it won't affect previous work (aka data loss) - data loss: some accident happens and you have to start from the beginning. The scheduler stop and restart from the beginning the whole process. 1.3 Review Part 1 Dask can be used to scale popular Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy allowing to analyse dataset with greater size (>8GB) Dask uses directed acyclical graph to coordinate execution of parallelized code across processors Directed acyclical graph are made up of nodes, clearly defined start and end that can be transverse in only one logical way (no looping). Upstream actions are completed before downstream nodes. Scaling out (i.e. add workers) can improve performances of complex workloads, however create overhead that can reduces gains. In case of failure, the step to reach a node can be repeated from the beginning without disturbing the rest of the process. Part 2: Introduction to DASK Warm up with short example of data cleaning using Dask DataFrames Visualize Directed Acyclical Graph generated by Dask workloads with graphviz Explore how the scheduler applies the DAGs to coordinate execution code You will learn: Dask DataFrame API Use diagnostic tool Use low-level Delayed API to create custom graph 2.1 Exploratory data analysis with DASK Set up environment and working directory Load data Check data quality issue (e.g. missing values and outliers) Drop columns (not useful for analysis AKA missing many values) 2.1.1 Set up environment and working directory In [31]: # import libraries import sys import os ## import dask libraries import dask.dataframe as dd from dask.diagnostics import ProgressBar # import libraries import pandas as pd In [4]: # assign working directory [CHANGE THIS].

Dask Name: from-delayed, 99 tasks note that metadata are shown in the frame instead of data sample syntax is pretty similar to Pandas API # partitions is the number of splits used to separate the main dataset. The optimal number is decided by the scheduler that split Pandas DataFrame into smaller chuncks. In this case each partitions is ~64MB (i.e. Dataset size/npartitions = 2GB/33). If we have one worker, Dask will cycle to each partition one at time. data types are reported under each column name (similary to describe method in Pandas, however performed through random sampling because data scattered across multiple physical machines). Good practice is to explicit data types instead relying on Dask's inference (store in binary format ideally, see links to Write and Read Parquet). Dask Name reports the name of the DAG (i.e. from-delayed) # tasks is the number of nodes in the DAG. You can think of a task as a Python function and in this case each partition operates 3 tasks: 1) reading the raw data, 2) splitting the data in appropriate blocks and, 3) initialazing the DataFrame object. Every task comes with some overhead (between 200us and 1ms). Partition process from Data Science with Python and Dask Want to know more?

By chaining together delayed object, you create the DAG Below are two examples, in the first one you build a DAG with one node only with dependencies and in the second one you build another with multiple nodes with dependencies 2.2.1 Example 1: DAG with one node with depenndecy In [17]: # import library import dask.delayed as delayed In [21]: def increment ( i ): return i + 1 def add ( x , y ): return x + y # wrap functions within dealyed object and chain x = delayed ( increment )( 1 ) y = delayed ( increment )( 2 ) z = delayed ( add )( x , y ) # visualize the DAG z . visualize () Out[21]: In [19]: # show the result z . compute () Out[19]: 5 note that to build a node wrap the function with the delayed object and then pass the arguments of the function. You could also use a decoretors (see documentation). circles symbolize function and computations while squares intermediate or final result incoming arrows represent dependecies. The increment function do not have any dependency while add function has two. Thus, add function has to wait until objects x and y have been calculated functions without dependencies can be computed independentely and a worker can be assigned to each one of them use method .visualize() on the last node with dependencies to peak at the DAG Dask does not compute the DAG . Use the method .compute() on the last node to see the result 2.2.2 Example 1: DAG with more than one node with dependencies we are going to build a more complex DAG with two layers: layer1 is built by looping over a list of data using a list comprehension to create dask delayed objects as \"leaves\" node. This layer combine the previously created function increment with the values in the list, then use the built in function sum to combine the results; layer2 is built looping on each object created in layer1 and In [26]: data = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] # compile first layer and visualize layer1 = [ delayed ( increment )( i ) for i in data ] total1 = delayed ( sum )( layer1 ) total1 . visualize () Out[26]: In [27]: def double ( x ): return x * 2 # compile second layer and visualize layer2 = [ delayed ( double )( j ) for j in layer1 ] total2 = delayed ( sum )( layer2 ) #.persist() total2 . visualize () Out[27]: In [28]: z = total2 . compute () z Out[28]: 40 note that built in function persistent using .persist() and it will be represented as a rectangle in the graph In [29]: ## TASK # visualize DAGs built from the DataFrame missing_count . visualize () Out[29]: Want to know more? Parallelize non DataFrame code 2.3 Task scheduling Dask performs the so called lazy computations. Remember, until you run the method .compute() all what Dask does is to split the process into smaller logical pieces (which avoid loading all the dataset) Even though the process is defined, the number of resources assigned and the place where the results will be stored are note assigned because the scheduler assign them dynamically. This allow to recover from worker failure, network unreliability as well as workers completing the tasks at different speeds. Dask uses a central scheduler to orchestrate all this work. It splits the workload among different servers which unlikely they are perfectly assigned the same load, power or access to data. Due to these conditions, scheduler needs to promptly react to avoid bottlenecks that will affect overall runtime. For best performance, a Dask cluster should use a distributed file system (S3, HDFS) to back its data storage. Assuming there are two nodes like in the image below and data are stored in one. In order to perform computation in the other node we have to move the data from one to the other creating an overhead proportional to the size of the data. The remedy is to split data minimizing the number of data to broadcast across different local machines. Local disk from Data Science with Python and Dask Dask scheduler takes data locality into consideration when deciding where to perform computation. 2.4 Review Part 2 The beauty of this code is that you can reuse in one machine or a thousand Similar syntax helps transition from Pandas to Dask (good in general for refactoring your code) Dask DataFrames is a tool to parallelize computing done popular Pandas that allow to clean and ananlyze large dataset Dask parallize Pandas Dataframe and more in general work using DAGs Computation are structured by the task scheduler using DAGs Computation are constructed lazily and then compute the method Use visualize method for a visual representation Computation can persist in memory avoid slowdown to replicate result Data locality help minimizing network and IO latency Part 3: Exercise with DASK 3.1 Learn how to manipulate structured data Build a Dask DataFrame from a Pandas DataFrame In [32]: # create lists with actions action_IDs = [ i for i in range ( 0 , 10 )] action_description = [ 'Clean dish' , 'Dress up' , 'Wash clothes' , 'Take shower' , 'Groceries' , 'Take shower' , 'Dress up' , 'Gym' , 'Take shower' , 'Movie' ] action_date = [ '2020-1-16' , '2020-1-16' , '2020-1-16' , '2020-1-16' , '2020-1-16' , '2020-1-17' , '2020-1-17' , '2020-1-17' , '2020-1-17' , '2020-1-17' ] # store list into Pandas DataFrame action_pandas_df = pd .

It is the task of identifying an object within an image or video/sequence. Traditionally, this field has leveraged advancements in mathematical and computer-aided modeling, and the design of objects. Several hand-annotated datasets have been developed over the years to test and evaluate image recognition systems. Traditional tecniques were dominating the scene and iteratively improving upon the task until recentely. In 2012, deep learning arrived at the ImageNet competition and opened the floodgates for rapid improvements and advancements in computer vision and deep learning techniques. 1.2 Introduction to Image Classification using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are at the heart of this deep learning revolution for improving the task of image classification. CNNs are specialized neural networks to handle image data. CNNs help us infer shift and space invariant features through their shared weight architectures, and are basically a variant of feed forward networks. Below is a quick overview of CNNs' components. source: WIKIPEDIA 1.3 Benchmark Datasets Image classification is a supervised task. The number of parameters to train a CNN might be huge, thus required a lot of labeled images and huge datasets are required. Luckily research groups across the globe have been working toward collecting, hand annotating, and crowdsourcing different datasets. These datasets are utilized to benchmark performance of different algorithms. Below is a short list of widely accepted benchmarking datasets in the field of image classification: ImageNet: 14M images, 20K categories, Princeton University, 2009 80 Millions Tiny Images datasets: 80M low resolution images colled from the internet, 75K non-abstract nouns, MIT. It is the basis for other famous datasets including CIFAR CIFAR-10: 60K low resolution images, 10 non-overlapping classes, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Most wide used dataset in ML CIFAR-100: 60K low resolution images evenly spread across 100 classes, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Common Object in Context (COCO): 200K images evenly spread across different classes. It is a large scale visual database for object identification, segmentation, and captioning Open Images: 9M images with labels Caltech 101 and Caltech 256: 9K and 30K images respectively, spanning across 101 and 256 classes Stanford Dog dataset: 20K colord images, 200 classes. It is specific to different dog breads MNIST: 60K hand-labeled digits (zero to nine). One of the most famous datasets for ML 1.4 State of the Art (SOTA) Deep Image Classification Models Deep learning has received much attention and hype over the years, it is not a surprised that a lot of conferences, journals and competitions worldwide centered around that. Image classification architectures have experienced iterative improvements on a regular basis. Let's look at the best SOTA models: AlexNet VGG-16 Inception (GoogleNet) ResNet MobileNet DenseNet see lecture 5 for more information about SOTAs Part 2: Use Cases Let's use Transfer Learning, to build some applications. It is convenient to run the applications on Google Colab. Check out the links below. 2.1 Image Classification and Transfer Learning You know what image classification is all about. Now we will use pretrained model(s) to understand how we can leverage transfer learning to improve upon our models. In particular we are going to focus on fine-grained image classification which refers to the task of recognizing different sublcasses within a higher-level class. We will focus around the Stanford Dogs Dataset which contains the images of different dog breeds. Hence the task is to categorize different dog breeds. We are going to train the model on a subset of the entire dataset. The keys areas of focus in this use case will be: Data preparation Train dog breeds classifier using Transfer Learning Find more on the colab notebook Lecture 6: Transfer Learning across Tasks: Image Classification and Transfer Learning 2.2 Style Transfer Painting present a complex interplay of content and style. Photograph are a combination of perspectives and lights. Let's combine them for spectacular and surprising results. Our goal is to modify the original image (a bird's eye view of the city of Venice) adding the style, colors and stroke paterns from a piece of art (in our case a mosaic designed by Gaudi') The outcome will be the result of a Transfer Learning algorithm presented in the paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style The key areas of focus in this use case will be: Understanding neural style transfer Image preprocessing Building loss function Constructing a custom optimizer Style transfer in action Find more on the colab notebook Lecture 6: Transfer Learning across Tasks: Style Transfer Model In [ ]: if (!document.getElementById('mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#')) { var mathjaxscript = document.createElement('script');

Part 1: Knowledge distillation: Teacher student learning Geoffrey Hinton's words: Many insects have two very different forms: a larval form: optimised to extract energy and nutrients from environment an adult form: optimized for traveling and reproduction ML typically uses the same model for training stage and the deployment stage! Despite very different requirements: Training: should extract structure, should not be real time, thus can use a huge amount of computation. Deployment: large number of users, more stringent requirements on latency and computational resources. Question: is it possible to distill and compress the knowledge of the large and complex training model (the teacher) into a small and simple deployment model (the student)? Brings us to the question what is knowledge (in a NN)? The weights of network? The mapping from input to output? Goal: train a student model to generalize in the same way as the large model. 1.1 Matching logits is a special case of distillation Normal training objective is to maximize the average log probability of the correct class. Yet Hinton: \" Relative probabilities of incorrect answers tell us a lot about how the teacher model tends to generalize. \" Ex.: \" An image of a BMW, may only have a very small chance of being mistaken for a garbage truck, but that mistake is still many times more probable than mistaking it for a carrot. \" The predictions of the teacher model contain a lot of usefull information regarding the generalization! Thus our student networks tries to match the teacher network predictions. The final loss-function of the student network ( $\\mathscr{L}_\\text{student }$ ) is a combination of: Standard cross entropy with correct labels ( $\\mathscr{L}_\\text{correct labels }$ ) ex. match label: 100% BWM Cross entropy with the soft targets from the teacher network predictions ( $\\mathscr{L}_\\text{soft teacher predictions }$ ) ex. match teacher prediction: 99.5% BWM, 0.4% garbage truk, ... , 0.000001% carrot How these two parts of the loss function should be weighted is determined by the hyperparameter $\\lambda$: $$\\mathscr{L}_\\text{student} = \\mathscr{L}_\\text{correct labels} + \\lambda \\mathscr{L}_\\text{soft teacher predictions}$$ 1.2 Temperature Much information resides in the ratios of very small probabilities in the predictions: ex.: one version of a 2 may be given a probability of $10&#94;{-6}$ of being a 3 and $10&#94;{-9}$ of being a 7 , whereas for another version it may be the other way around. Since most probabilities are very close to zero we expect very little influence on the cross-entropy cost function. How to fix this? Raise the \"temperature\" of the final softmax until the teacher model produces a soft set of targets ($z_i$ are logits, T is Temperature): $$q_i = \\dfrac{\\exp(z_i/T)}{\\sum_j \\exp(z_j/T)}$$ Using a higher value for $T$ produces a softer probability distribution over classes. Illustrating: In [16]: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt z_i = np . array ([ 0.5 , 8 , 1.5 , 3 , 6 , 11 , 2.5 , 0.01 , 5 , 0.2 ]) # Tested probabilities Temperatures = [ 1 , 4 , 20 ] plt . figure ( figsize = ( 20 , 4 )) for i , T in enumerate ( Temperatures ): plt . subplot ( 1 , 4 , i + 1 ) # Temperature adjusted soft probabilities: q_i = np . exp ( z_i / T ) / np . sum ( np . exp ( z_i / T )) # Plotting the barchart plt . bar ( range ( 0 , 10 ), q_i ) plt . title ( 'Temperature = ' + str ( T ), size = 15 ) plt . xticks ( range ( 10 ) , range ( 10 ), size = 10 ) plt . xlabel ( 'Classes' , size = 12 ) plt . ylabel ( 'Class Probabilities' , size = 12 ) plt . axhline ( y = 1 , linestyle = '--' , color = 'r' ) plt . subplot ( 1 , 4 , 4 ) plt . bar ( range ( 0 , 10 ), z_i / 30 ) plt . axhline ( y = 1 , linestyle = '--' , color = 'r' ) plt . ylim ( 0 , 1.05 ) plt . title ( 'Logits ' ) Out[16]: Text(0.5,1,'Logits ') 1.3 Examples from the paper Experiment 1: simple MNIST Large Teacher network - 2 layers of 1200 neurons hidden units: 67 /10000 test errors. Original student network - 2 layers of 800 neurons hidden units: 146 /10000 test errors. Distilled student network - 2 layers of 800 neurons hidden units: 74 /10000 test error. Experiment 2: Distillation can even teach a student network about classes it has never seen: During training all the \"3\" digits are hidden for the student network. So \"3\" is a mythicial digit the student network never has seen! Still using distillation it manages to correctly classify 877 out of 1010 \"3\"s in the test set! After adjusting the bias term 997/1010 3's are correctly classified! Part 2: Use Cases Let's use Transfer Learning, to build some applications. It is convenient to run the applications on Google Colab. Check out the links below. 2.1Transfer learning through Network Distillation In distillation a small simple ( student ) network tries to extract or distill knowledge from a large and complex ( teacher ) network. This is also known as student-teacher networks or compression, as we try to compress a large model into a small model. Goal: Understand Knowledge Distillation Force a small segmentation network (based on Mobilenet) to learn from a large network (deeplab_v3).
